# Predicting-Employee-Attrition
Real World Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Project (Predicting Employee Attrition)
In this project we are going to predict employee attrition, using machine learning techniques.


So in this project, we will use a specific dataset that contains different attributes, and based on those attributes, we will see whether a person, a better employee left the company or not.


As always, we will launch our project by import our libraries, then we will do an extensive exploratory analysis, data Cleaning and data visualization. After that, we will be doing some feature selection, then we will do some desired steps in the phase of machine learning:

*-* Splitting our data into the train and test set.

*-* Importing and using our specific models (Logistic Regression Model, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost Classifier).

*-* Applying k-Fold Cross Validation and Classification Report for each machine learning model.

*-* Variable Importance and Hperparameter Tuning to find the best score and the best params, after completing that you will see the final results that we achieved.
